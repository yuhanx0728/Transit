# Transit

[demo video coming soon]

Tired of having to keep my eyes on the phone to check bus arrivals while getting ready for school every morning, I decided to create a Google Home action that allows me to check the real-time bus status for Pittsburgh public transport.

## Setting up the webhook
Realizing that a webhook is necessary to interact with the pittsburgh transport API, I researched and tried out different frameworks to construct a webhook. In the end I settled with [flask assistant](https://flask-assistant.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Testing the webhook
Heroku
npm

## Other new stuff I learned
1. Working with Dialogflow(I know how to make a simple chatbot now);
2. Parsing a JSON object;
3. Working with APIs.

## Future development
- [ ] permanent storage
- [ ] 

## How to use Transit
Transit is not open to public *yet*, but just to show you, this is how a conversation would go when you want to check your bus:

"Hi google, ask Transit to check the bus to school."
"The bus is coming in 6 minutes."

"Hi google, ask Transit to check the bus back home."
"Probably no bus is coming right now."
